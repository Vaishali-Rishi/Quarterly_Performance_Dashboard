# Quarterly Performance Dashboard : CRM Sales Opportunities

## 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄
In the Maven Sales Challenge (Maven Analytics), I played the role of a BI Developer for MavenTech, a company specializing in the sale of computer hardware to large enterprises. The company has been utilizing a new CRM system to monitor their sales opportunities, but lacked the ability to visualize the data beyond the CRM platform.
To address this, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows sales managers to monitor their team's quarterly performance effectively.

The dataset comprised records exported from MavenTech's CRM system, spanning from October 2016 to December 2017. It included details on sales opportunities, covering information such as product types, customer accounts, and the outcome of each sales opportunity (won or lost).

Given the interactive nature of the dashboard, I also emphasized on making it user-friendly. The dashboard consists of three main sections:

1. Main Page- Displays the most crucial information for sales managers including, (KPIs) with figures for the previous quarter and QoQ growth rates, an overview of the selected manager’s team performance for the chosen quarter across various metrics, as well as a summary of product performance.

2. Metric Breakdown- Offers a detailed analysis of the selected metric, enabling performance evaluation of the selected manager's team for the chosen quarter across multiple metrics.

3. Performance Trends Over Time- Presents the team's performance trends on a quarterly basis.
